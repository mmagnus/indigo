# DCA-MOL: A PyMOL Plugin To Analyze Direct Evolutionary Couplings

Aleksandra I. JarmolinskaQin ZhouJoanna I. Sulkowska, Faruck Morcos

- Direct coupling analysis (DCA) is a statistical modeling framework designed to uncover relevant molecular evolutionary relationships from biological sequences.
- Although DCA has been successfully used in several applications, mapping and visualizing of evolutionary couplings and direct information to a particular set of molecules requires multiple steps and could be prone to errors.
- DCA-MOL extends PyMOL functionality to allow users to interactively analyze and visualize coevolutionary residue–residue interactions between contact maps and structures.
- True positive rates for the top N pairs can be computed and visualized in real-time to evaluate the quality of residue–residue contact predictions.
- Different types of interactions in monomeric proteins, RNA, molecular interfaces, and protein conformational dynamics as well as multiple protein complexes can be studied efficiently within one application.
- DCA-MOL is available for download from <http://dca-mol.cent.uw.edu.pl>
